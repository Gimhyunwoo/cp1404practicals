# Reflection - Practical 10

## 1. What do you think you’ve learned so far in this subject?

I've learned how to write modular Python programs using functions and classes, test them using assert and doctest, and structure projects using branches and version control. I also practiced using APIs and building graphical and web-based interfaces.

## 2. What have you enjoyed the most?

I enjoyed working with Flask and creating web interfaces. It was exciting to see Python code running on a browser and interacting with live data from Wikipedia using an API.

## 3. What has been the most challenging?

The most challenging part was understanding how to properly handle exceptions in API calls, especially when the results were ambiguous or pages were missing.

## 4. What would you like to learn more about?

I'd like to explore more about deploying Flask apps to the web and building full-featured web applications, including forms, databases, and authentication.

## 5. Anything else you’d like to reflect on?

This subject helped me understand the importance of writing reusable code and separating concerns, especially when making console, GUI, and web interfaces for the same logic.
