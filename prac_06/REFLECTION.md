# Reflection

## What did you learn from this prac?
- More confidence using classes and methods.
- Learned how to encapsulate behavior (e.g. `is_dynamic`, `is_vintage`).

## What did you find difficult or surprising?
- Remembering to keep `self` consistent, and not pass data an object already knows.

## What would you do differently next time?
- Plan time for testing earlier to avoid retyping test inputs.
